BSS might need an update if you didn't install the latest version.

## Creating a project
On the projects overview, click on 'add project'. You want to set a project name, a namespace, a workspace folder and an export folder. The workspace folder is where you'll be placing your JS files. The export folder will show your files once they've been compiled.

Then open the project by clicking on the project in the list and you're ready to go!

## The workspace
You can use any text editor that you like to edit files. Once you written your code: click 'compile' to let BSS do it's magic.

## The code
