# Contributing to BSS
I encurage other developers to contribute to BSS. Like adding new features or adding to the documentation.

If you want to contribute, follow these steps:

* Fork the project so you have a version to work on
* Make your contribution
* Create a pull request

There are a couple of restrictions when it comes to contributing to the code.

* If there are any requests made to an external source (server, website, etc) the contribution will be ignored.

If you contribute to this project, the following will happen:

* The contribution will be reviewed and may be changed to better suit the project (like changing single-quotes to dubble-quotes etc)
* After the contribution has been reviewed, you'll be placed inside a list of contributers on github, the website and file you contributed on.
